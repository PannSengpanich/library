# Library
The Library project is a web development project included in The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript Course. It is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to create a library of books they have read or want to read. The project provides an opportunity for developers to practice their front-end  development skills and gain experience in building full-stack web applications.

The goal of the project is to build a fully functional library web application that allows users to add books to their library, mark books as read or not read, and delete books from their library.

The project provides an opportunity to practice working on:

1. Creating dynamic web pages using JavaScript: In this project, developers will learn how to use JavaScript to create dynamic web pages that respond to user input. They will also learn how to manipulate the DOM to display and update data in real-time.

2. Handling user input: Developers will learn how to handle user input in the form of form submissions.
