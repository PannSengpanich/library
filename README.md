# Library
The Library project is a web development project included in The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript Course. It is a simple front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to create a library of books they have read or want to read. The project provides an opportunity for developers to practice their front-end development skills and gain experience in building user interfaces.

The goal of the project is to build a fully functional library web application that allows users to add books to their library, mark books as read or not read, and delete books from their library. This project will help developers to understand how to create dynamic web pages, manipulate the DOM, and handle user input.
